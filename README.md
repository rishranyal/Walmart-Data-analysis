**Walmart Data Exploration**

**Overview**

This project examines Walmart's sales data to identify high-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends, and understand customer purchasing patterns. The goal is to uncover insights that can enhance sales strategies and optimize business performance. The dataset for this study was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.
In this competition, participants were provided with historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across various regions. Each store has multiple departments, and the task involves predicting sales at the department level. The dataset also includes holiday markdown events, which influence sales but are challenging to quantify in terms of their impact on different departments.


**Project Objectives**

The primary aim is to analyze Walmart's sales data to identify key factors influencing sales performance across different branches. This will help in understanding trends and improving sales strategies.
